description: >
  Tanintharyi island rainforest occurs on offshore islands across Tanintharyi,
  including the Myeik archipelago. It is a lowland, primarily evergreen, forest
  ecosystem that has some maritime influence. It shows a tolerance of salty
  ocean seaspray and historically received much of its nutrient input from
  nesting seabird populations that have subsequently collapsed. It occurs across
  a wide range of island types including limestone, rubble and sand islands. The
  canopy is primarily evergreen Dipterocarpaceae (Tagane et al., 2019). Stamp
  (1924b) reported forests of “tall varied trees who dense canopy, cutting off
  nearly all light from the ground, is made more intense by the wealth of woody
  climbers which have struggled upwards to reach the light”.
distribution: >
  Occurs on offshore islands in Tanintharyi state.
characteristic_native_biota: >
  Largely unknown but probably moderately diverse. A recent survey of the Myiek
  archipelago reported a total of 305 species belonging to 241 genera and 91
  families (Tagane et al. 2019). Surveys of Lampi Island marine park indicated
  20 species of Dipterocarpaceae. The islands support several localized species
  along the coastal edges including Great-billed Heron Ardea sumatrana, Beach
  Thick-knee Esacus magnirostris (NT) and Black-naped Tern Sterna sumatrana, and
  Collared Kingfisher Todiramphus chloris. The islands also support a range of
  nomadic frugivores including Nicobar Pigeon Caloenas nicobarica (NT), Large
  Green-pigeon Treron capellei (VU), Pied Imperialpigeon Ducula bicolor, and
  Plain-pouched Hornbill Rhyticeros subruficollis (VU).

  The islands also support a population of tool using Long-tailed Macaque Macaca
  fascicularis (VU).
abiotic_environment: >
  This ecosystem occurs on offshore islands exposed to the influence of maritime
  salt. Largely monsoonal, with a minimum temperature of 21 degrees in December
  to a maximum of 28.8 in August. Precipitation is highly seasonal, with a dry
  season occurring from November to March followed by a strong wet season from
  May to October (Oo et al., 2019).
key_processes_and_interactions: >
  This ecosystem received much of its nutrients from nesting seabird populations
  that are mostly no longer present. Dispersal is similarly mediated by mobile
  fauna, and endemism due to isolation is likely to be high.
major_threats: >
  Unregulated tourism development is the principal threat to this ecosystem
  (UNESCO, 2014).
ecosystem_collapse_definition: >
  This ecosystem is regarded as collapsed when its area has declined to zero,
  when the proportion of the ecosystem considered primary forest declines to 0.
assessment_summary: >
  This ecosystem is broadly distributed across many isolated islands in southern
  Myanmar, but there is an expected reduction in climate suitability over the
  next three decades. Threats from humans and biotic degradation are expected to
  be low, as confirmed by an analysis of the Forest Landscape Integrity Index.
  The ecosystem qualified for listing as Vulnerable under Criterion C, with a
  plausible range of Least Concern – Vulnerable. Vulnerable (Least Concern –
  Vulnerable).

criterion_a_description: >
  No time-series map data was available for assessing reduction in distribution
  of this ecosystem over any of the assessment time frames. **Data Deficient.**
criterion_b_description: >
  AOO and EOO were measured as 206 10 x 10 km grid cells and 50,337 km2,
  respectively. There is no evidence that suggests this ecosystem should meet
  the criteria to be listed as Near Threatened. The ecosystem is assessed as
  Least Concern under Criterion B1 and B2. **Least Concern.**
criterion_c_description: >
  An environmental suitability model (Ferrer-Paris et al. 2019; see methods)
  suggests that reductions in climate suitability will occur with an extent and
  severity to meet the category thresholds for Vulnerable under Criterion C2a.
  Variation in the outcomes of the modelled scenarios suggested that the
  ecosystem could potentially meet thresholds for Least Concern to Vulnerable,
  and therefore the ecosystem is assessed as Vulnerable (the most commonly
  returned result from all scenarios), with plausible bounds of Least Concern –
  Vulnerable. **Vulnerable (Least Concern – Vulnerable).**
criterion_d_description: >
  Analyses of a dataset that depicts the distribution of primary forests in
  South-East Asia (Potapov et al. 2019) suggest that 74.9% of the remaining
  extent of this ecosystem is primary forest. If 100% of the ecosystem is
  assumed to be primary forest in 1750, we estimate a 25.1% loss in primary
  forest extent since 1750. Here we assume that loss of primary forest extent
  has a relative severity of >90%, and the ecosystem is assessed as Least
  Concern under Criterion D3. Analyses of the full time-series of primary forest
  data (n = 18) suggests an 8.1% reduction of primary forest in this ecosystem
  over the period 2000-2017. A linear model fit to this dataset suggests that
  primary forest cover in this ecosystem will not decline sufficiently to meet
  any category thresholds over a 50 year period (1984-2034). The ecosystem is
  assessed as Least Concern under Criterion D2b. **Least Concern.** <img
