description: >
  Tanintharyi has extensive patches of limestone karst scattered across the
  region. In these karst landscapes Tanintharyi limestone tropical evergreen
  forest occurs. Primary tree species are Dipterocarps that form a closed
  canopy, although they occur at lower density and lower tree height than
  surrounding lowland and upland evergreen forest ecosystems. Soils are
  characteristically extremely shallow and acidic, and may be humusrich. These
  forests can be found across the Tanintharyi lowlands on limestone hills and
  slopes, and in some cases may occur on very steep slopes and cliffs. As a
  result of the discontinuous distribution of limestone in Myanmar, which can
  frequently become very dry, endemism is very high. For example, 12 new
  karst-adapted species of gecko were recently discovered in karst environments,
  some of which are restricted to isolated caves and limestone towers (Grismer
  et al. 2018). Reliable year round rainfall, averaging in excess of 100 mm per
  month and between around 1,900 mm and 3,000 mm per year.

distribution: >
  Occurs in karst landscapes in southern Tanintharyi. We used a global karst
  layer to refine our maps of this ecosystem type, and further work to map karst
  landscapes in southern Myanmar is recommended.

characteristic_native_biota: >
  Characteristic species of this ecosystem remain relatively unknown. Stamp
  (1924b) lists the tree species occurring in this ecosystem as including
  Dipterocarpus alatus, D. grandiflorus, and D. turbinatus, Shorea spp,
  Anisoptera sp., Hopea odorata, and Parashorea stellata.

  This ecosystem occurs in isolated fragments and has high physical complexity,
  a suite of microhabitats, and relatively stable climate, this ecosystem
  provides habitat for a large number of endemic species, including gekkos and
  molluscs (Whitten et al., 1997; Grismer et al., 2018).

  This ecosystem supports some of the remaining populations of sundaic avifauna
  in Myanmar. This includes Great Argus Argusianus argus (NT), Storm's Stork
  Ciconia stormi (EN), White-crowned Hornbill Berenicornis comatus (EN),
  Helmeted Hornbill Rhinoplax vigil (CR), Red-throated Barbet Psilopogon
  mystacophanos (NT), Blue-rumped Parrot Psittinus cyanurus (NT), Banded
  Broadbill Eurylaimus harterti, Black-and-yellow Broadbill Eurylaimus
  ochromalus (NT), Green Broadbill Calyptomena viridis (NT), Crested Jay
  Platylophus galericulatus (NT), as well as a range of Bulbuls (Pycnonotidae)
  and Ground Babblers (Pellorneidae).

  The mammalian fauna is equally impressive with populations of Banded Langur
  Presbytis femoralis robinsoni (NT), Dusky Langur Trachypithecus obscurus (NT),
  Lar Gibbon Hylobates lar (EN), Banded Civet Hemigalus derbyanus (NT), Tiger
  Panthera tigris (EN), Mainland Clouded Leopard Neofelis nebulosa (VU), Asian
  Elephant Elephas maximus (EN) and Malayan Tapir Tapirus indicus (EN; Eames et
  al., 2005).

abiotic_environment: >
  Shallow soils that can be fairly acidic, topographically complex and reliable
  year-round rainfall of >100 mm per month and warm temperature that rarely fall
  below 10° C.

key_processes_and_interactions: >
  Distribution is largely defined by the occurrence of Karst landscapes
  coinciding with a mean monthly rainfall of around 100 mm per month. This
  ecosystem may periodically become very dry, but a dense evergreen canopy can
  support humid microclimates throughout these periods (Whitten et al., 1997).

major_threats: >
  Unregulated quarrying is considered a primary threat to this ecosystem
  (Grismer et al., 2018). In addition, deforestation is widespread in this
  region, primarily for the development of oil palm plantations, rubber
  plantations and other agroforestry, with deforestation rates reaching 7.85% in
  some areas of Tanintharyi, the highest rate of forest loss so far recorded in
  Myanmar (Connette et al., 2017).

ecosystem_collapse_definition: >
  This ecosystem is regarded as collapsed when its area has declined to zero, or
  when the proportion of the ecosystem considered primary forest declines to 0.

assessment_summary: >
  This ecosystem is highly restricted to limestone substrates and ongoing
  threats, particularly from quarrying, suggest that this ecosystem is
  undergoing a continuing decline. **Endangered.**
