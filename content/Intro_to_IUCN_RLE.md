## Introduction to the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems

The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) aims to support conservation in resource use and
management decisions by identifying ecosystems most at risk of loss or collapse {cite}`keith2013scientific,keith2015iucn`.
Similar to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the outcome of an RLE assessment is a list of ecosystems and their status for a region (Figure 1.4; {cite}`rodriguez2011establishing`).
Because the RLE was developed to promote a consistent framework suitable for assessing and
monitoring the status of ecosystems, it enables comparisons of collapse risk between countries,
locations and ecosystem types {cite}`keith2013scientific`.

For further information on the development of the RLE protocol, the theory and scientific foundations upon which they were developed, and detailed information on the purpose of each of the five criteria refer to the Guidelines for the application of IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Categories and Criteria {cite}`bland2017guidelines`.
More information on the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems, is available in multiple languages on the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems website ([www.iucnrle.org](https://www.iucnrle.org)).

Assessments of ecosystem types (commonly termed 'assessment units' within Red List of Ecosystems assessments) are conducted by applying five criteria and their associated thresholds, enabling each ecosystem type to be classified according to their risk of collapse (termed 'status').
To ensure the assessment process is transparent and repeatable, each ecosystem type is clearly described according to the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems guidelines {cite}`bland2017guidelines`.
This standard approach of applying the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Categories and Criteria to clearly described ecosystems is critical to allow for accurate, comparable and repeatable assessments of ecosystems status and to contribute to the global IUCN Red List of Ecosystems programme.
