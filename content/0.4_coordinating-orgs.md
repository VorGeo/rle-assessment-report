# Coordinating Organizations

## Wildlife Conservation Society

The Wildlife Conservation Society is a globally distributed science-based conservation organization,
producing and disseminating the information and knowledge necessary to inform and improve
conservation and management action in wild places. With field conservation operations in nearly 60
nations and all of the world's oceans, WCS has supported governments and communities in the
creation or expansion of 245 protected areas. WCS employs more than 170 PhD and DVM
scientists and have trained and funded generations of field and zoo colleagues, many of whom are
now leaders in conservation science, wildlife veterinary medicine, and curatorial research around
the world.

## Centre for Ecosystem Science, University of New South Wales

The University of New South Wales (UNSW) is a focal point for environmental research, and has
research strengths that include conservation biology, environmental risk management and coastal
and estuarine ecology. Hosted at UNSW, the Centre for Ecosystem Science (CES) is a world leader
in ecosystem research, its application and communication of environmental change. It has well-
established research strengths in environmental risk assessment, and has deep involvement in
award winning ecosystem management programs such as the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems
initiative. The CES has five major programs focused on biodiversity of ecosystems: wetlands and
rivers; terrestrial ecosystems; marine ecosystems; remote sensing and GIS, and conservation policy
and management.
