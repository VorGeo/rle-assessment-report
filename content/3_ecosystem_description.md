# Ecosystem description and assessment

Ecosystem accounts provided in this section consist of two components, an
ecosystem description and a detailed summary of the application of the IUCN Red
List of Ecosystem criteria.
The ecosystem description follows the standard format suggested by the IUCN.
Ecosystem descriptions are an essential component of IUCN Red List of Ecosystems
assessments and serve the purpose of clearly defining each assessment unit.
This allows repeated application of the categories and criteria to a single
defined unit and supports red listing and cross-walking at the
global scale.
The associated assessment section provides the details the Red List assessments,
including the data sources, methods of analysis, evidence statements and key
references.
