# Glossary {.unnumbered}

Area of occupancy (AOO)
:   A standardised measure of the area that is occupied by an ecosystem type.

Extent of occurrence (EOO)
:   A standardised measure of the area within which all occurrences of an ecosystem type exist

Tropical-subtropical forests biome (T1) {#term-tropical-subtropical-forests-biome}
:   The Tropical-subtropical forests biome includes moderate to highly productive ecosystems with closed tree canopies occurring at lower latitudes north and south of the equator.

Tropical/Subtropical lowland rainforests (T1.1) {#term-tropical-subtropical-lowland-rainforests}
:   These closed-canopy forests are renowned for their complex structure and high primary productivity, which support high functional and taxonomic diversity.

Criterion A {#term-criterion-a}
:   Reduction in geographic distribution

Criterion B {#term-criterion-b}
:   Restricted geographic distribution

Criterion C {#term-criterion-c}
:   Criterion C assesses declines in ecosystem functions or processes based on symptoms of abiotic (environmental) degradation.

Criterion D {#term-criterion-d}
:   Criterion D assesses declines in ecosystem functions or processes disruption of biotic processes, including declines of biota with key functional roles.

Criterion E {#term-criterion-e}
:   Quantitative risk analysis
