**Area of occupancy (AOO)**
A standardised measure of the area that is occupied by an ecosystem type.

**Extent of occurrence (EOO)**
A standardised measure of the area within which all occurrences of an ecosystem type exist

**Tropical-subtropical forests biome (T1)**
The Tropical-subtropical forests biome includes moderate to highly productive ecosystems with closed tree canopies occurring at lower latitudes north and south of the equator.

**Tropical/Subtropical lowland rainforests (T1.1)**
These closed-canopy forests are renowned for their complex structure and high primary productivity, which support high functional and taxonomic diversity.

**Criterion A**
Reduction in geographic distribution

**Criterion B**
Restricted geographic distribution

**Criterion C**
Criterion C assesses declines in ecosystem functions or processes based on symptoms of abiotic (environmental) degradation.

**Criterion D**
Criterion D assesses declines in ecosystem functions or processes disruption of biotic processes, including declines of biota with key functional roles.

**Criterion E**
Quantitative risk analysis
