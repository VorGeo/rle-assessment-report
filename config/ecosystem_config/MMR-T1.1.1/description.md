Tanintharyi island rainforest occurs on offshore islands across Tanintharyi,
including the Myeik archipelago. It is a lowland, primarily evergreen, forest
ecosystem that has some maritime influence. It shows a tolerance of salty
ocean seaspray and historically received much of its nutrient input from
nesting seabird populations that have subsequently collapsed. It occurs across
a wide range of island types including limestone, rubble and sand islands. The
canopy is primarily evergreen Dipterocarpaceae [@tagane2019contributions].
@stamp1925vegetation reported forests of “tall varied trees who dense canopy,
cutting off nearly all light from the ground, is made more intense by the
wealth of woody climbers which have struggled upwards to reach the light”.
