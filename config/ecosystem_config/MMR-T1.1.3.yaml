description: >
  Tanintharyi has extensive patches of limestone karst scattered across the
  region. In these karst landscapes Tanintharyi limestone tropical evergreen
  forest occurs. Primary tree species are Dipterocarps that form a closed
  canopy, although they occur at lower density and lower tree height than
  surrounding lowland and upland evergreen forest ecosystems. Soils are
  characteristically extremely shallow and acidic, and may be humusrich. These
  forests can be found across the Tanintharyi lowlands on limestone hills and
  slopes, and in some cases may occur on very steep slopes and cliffs. As a
  result of the discontinuous distribution of limestone in Myanmar, which can
  frequently become very dry, endemism is very high. For example, 12 new
  karst-adapted species of gecko were recently discovered in karst environments,
  some of which are restricted to isolated caves and limestone towers (Grismer
  et al. 2018). Reliable year round rainfall, averaging in excess of 100 mm per
  month and between around 1,900 mm and 3,000 mm per year.

distribution: >
  Occurs in karst landscapes in southern Tanintharyi. We used a global karst
  layer to refine our maps of this ecosystem type, and further work to map karst
  landscapes in southern Myanmar is recommended.

characteristic_native_biota: >
  Characteristic species of this ecosystem remain relatively unknown.
  @stamp1925vegetation lists the tree species occurring in this ecosystem as
  including Dipterocarpus alatus, D. grandiflorus, and D. turbinatus, Shorea
  spp, Anisoptera sp., Hopea odorata, and Parashorea stellata.

  This ecosystem occurs in isolated fragments and has high physical complexity,
  a suite of microhabitats, and relatively stable climate, this ecosystem
  provides habitat for a large number of endemic species, including gekkos and
  molluscs (Whitten et al., 1997; Grismer et al., 2018).

  This ecosystem supports some of the remaining populations of sundaic avifauna
  in Myanmar. This includes Great Argus Argusianus argus (NT), Storm's Stork
  Ciconia stormi (EN), White-crowned Hornbill Berenicornis comatus (EN),
  Helmeted Hornbill Rhinoplax vigil (CR), Red-throated Barbet Psilopogon
  mystacophanos (NT), Blue-rumped Parrot Psittinus cyanurus (NT), Banded
  Broadbill Eurylaimus harterti, Black-and-yellow Broadbill Eurylaimus
  ochromalus (NT), Green Broadbill Calyptomena viridis (NT), Crested Jay
  Platylophus galericulatus (NT), as well as a range of Bulbuls (Pycnonotidae)
  and Ground Babblers (Pellorneidae).

  The mammalian fauna is equally impressive with populations of Banded Langur
  Presbytis femoralis robinsoni (NT), Dusky Langur Trachypithecus obscurus (NT),
  Lar Gibbon Hylobates lar (EN), Banded Civet Hemigalus derbyanus (NT), Tiger
  Panthera tigris (EN), Mainland Clouded Leopard Neofelis nebulosa (VU), Asian
  Elephant Elephas maximus (EN) and Malayan Tapir Tapirus indicus (EN;
  @eames2005priority).

abiotic_environment: >
  Shallow soils that can be fairly acidic, topographically complex and reliable
  year-round rainfall of >100 mm per month and warm temperature that rarely fall
  below 10° C.

key_processes_and_interactions: >
  Distribution is largely defined by the occurrence of Karst landscapes
  coinciding with a mean monthly rainfall of around 100 mm per month. This
  ecosystem may periodically become very dry, but a dense evergreen canopy can
  support humid microclimates throughout these periods (Whitten et al., 1997).

major_threats: >
  Unregulated quarrying is considered a primary threat to this ecosystem
  (Grismer et al., 2018). In addition, deforestation is widespread in this
  region, primarily for the development of oil palm plantations, rubber
  plantations and other agroforestry, with deforestation rates reaching 7.85% in
  some areas of Tanintharyi, the highest rate of forest loss so far recorded in
  Myanmar [@connette2017rapid].

ecosystem_collapse_definition: >
  This ecosystem is regarded as collapsed when its area has declined to zero, or
  when the proportion of the ecosystem considered primary forest declines to 0.

assessment_summary: >
  This ecosystem is highly restricted to limestone substrates and ongoing
  threats, particularly from quarrying, suggest that this ecosystem is
  undergoing a continuing decline.

criterion_a_description: >
  No time-series map data was available for assessing reduction in distribution
  of this ecosystem over any of the assessment time frames. **Data Deficient**.

criterion_b_description: >
  This ecosystem is highly restricted in limestone landscapes and has an AOO of
  56 10 x 10 km grid cells and an EOO of 3,796 km2 There is evidence that
  limestone quarrying and other threats are leading to continuing decline,
  meeting subcriteria a(i) and a(iii). The ecosystem is assessed as
  **Endangered**.

criterion_c_description: >
  Climate simulation models suggest that environmental conditions within the
  limestone landscapes of southern Myanmar are unlikely to reduce suitable areas
  sufficiently to result in this ecosystem becoming threatened by 2050. It
  should be noted that the occurrence of Karst landscapes is a key
  distributional driver of this ecosystem, and the scale at which the
  suitability models were run may not adequately depict the fine-scale changes
  expected over the next three decades. We recommend further work to refine maps
  of Karst landscape to better limit the distribution of our model. **Least
  Concern**.

criterion_d_description: >
  Remote sensing analyses suggest that 72.4% of the remaining extent of this
  ecosystem meets criteria to be classified as primary forest (Potapov et al.,
  2019). If 100% of the ecosystem is assumed to be primary forest in 1750, there
  has been an 27.6% loss in primary forest extent since 1750. We assume that
  loss of primary forest has a relative severity of >90%, and use the extent of
  primary forest loss as a biotic variable for assessing Criterion D. With an
  27.6% loss of primary forest extent, the ecosystem is assessed as Least
  Concern under Criterion D3. Analyses of the time-series of primary forest data
  (n = 18 time points) indicate that there has been 8.4% reduction in primary
  forest cover over the period 2000-2017. A linear model fit to this dataset,
  assuming that collapse occurs at 100% loss of primary forest cover, suggests
  that primary forest loss in this ecosystem will not occur to an extent to meet
  any category thresholds over a 50 year period (1984- 2034). The ecosystem is
  assessed as Least Concern under Criterion D2b. **Least Concern**.

criterion_e_description: >
  No models were used to assess Criterion E. **Not Evaluated**.
